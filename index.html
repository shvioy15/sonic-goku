        Gogeta is the Metamoran Fusion of Goku and Vegeta, formed save the
        entire DBS Multiverse from jeopardy. While all fusions have immense
        power, Gogeta's power is abnormal even by regular standards, as Vegeta=
        and Goku's intense rivalry has brought out an exceptional power. He is
        currently the strongest fusion out there as his mere presence fear all
        of the Gods of Destruction and the Angels. Master Martial Artist,
        Superhuman Physical Characteristics, Acrobatics, Analytical Prediction,
        Ki Manipulation (Can be used defensively and offensively, to strengthen
        his skin or to fire ki blasts, which can home in on targets, change the
        weather, and form defensive barriers that can keep out poisons and
        render absorption ineffective), Ki Sensing (Can locate others by reading
        their ki and detect emotions), Enhanced Senses (Saiyans have exceptional
        senses, allowing Gogeta to locate small, distant objects by tracking
        their smell, see clearly over long distances, and track the movements of
        others even in pitch black conditions by feeling vibrations in the air),
        Afterimage Creation, Explosion Manipulation, Can project fire balls,
        Flight, Pressure Point Strikes, Power Mimicry (Can easily replicate
        other Ki-based techniques after seeing them once), Light Manipulation
        (Can create flashes of light to blind opponents), Telepathy (Can
        telepathically communicate with others and read minds), Teleportation,
        Dimensional Travel, BFR, Telekinesis, Healing, Self-Destruction, Sealing
        with the Mafuba, Limited Power Nullification, Paralysis Inducement,
        Shockwaves Generation, Rage Power, Reactive Power Level (As a Saiyan,
        Gogeta grows stronger every time he fights and can become stronger in
        the midst of combat, vastly increasing in strength whenever he is
        mortally injured), Statistics Amplification (Should be capable of using
        Kaio-ken to greatly enhance his capabilities by potentially up to twenty
        times or more), Transformation (Can transform into a Super Saiyan and
        Super Saiyan Blue, increasing his capabilities drastically), Possibly
        Sound Manipulation and Portal Creation (Characters stronger than or
        equal to Super Buu and Gotenks should be able to perform the Vice Shout
        through sheer power), Adapted to Gravity via the Gravity Machine, Can
        block Intangible attacks, Resistance to Radiations, Poison, Paralysis,
        Mind Manipulation, Time Stop, Existence Erasure, Heat, Absolute Zero,
        Empathic Manipulation and Void Manipulation, Danmaku and Limited
        Space-Time Manipulation (Transported himself and Broly into another
        dimension and shattered multiple of them until they transported
        themselves back to Earth) as a Super Saiyan, Energy / Ki Absorption,
        Regeneration (Mid-Low), Attack Reflection, Electricity Manipulation | As
        a Super Saiyan Blue all previous abilities on a greatly enhanced scale

        beings lesser than a God) as a Super Saiyan Blue, Reality Warping,
        Conceptual Manipulation, Law Manipulation, Time Manipulation, Spatial
        Manipulation, and Death Manipulation, Reality Warping (Warped the entire
        DBS Multiverse back together after destroying it for the first time),
        Non-Physical Interaction, Conceptual Manipulation (Type 2), Void
        Manipulation (Via Hakai), Limited Plot Manipulation, Regeneration
        Negation (Up to High-Godly), and Fate Manipulation | Same as above on an
